LYL - Live your life. This is a game that I made when I was 15 years old. Disclaimer: The character and car controls are from the assets shop. Although game models are purchased, I created the level design. The game is more of an idea of what I wanted to build, thus it is not completely done and has many flaws. But this is the only game I was able to export and publish. Working on it gave me a lot of experience and knowledge about the Unity engine, C# programming, and game development.
